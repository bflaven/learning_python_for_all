**Python for Teenagers: Learn to Program like a Superhero! by James R. Payne**



What I like in Python is that without being a true developer more self-taught one, you can understand in much more easy way how to program. I decide to go for it.

The force indentation, even it is annoying at the very beginning, it lets the code logic appears like trouts in mountain river's crystal waters then it is much more easier to fish mistakes than in a muddy code soup.


**The Benefits of Python**

- Increased productivity: 
By some reports, Python can increase a
programmer's productivity – how much work they can accomplish
in a given time – by as much as ten times! It literally is faster than a
speeding bullet!

- Extensibility: 
One great advantage of Python is the fact that it has a very extensive library of, well, libraries. A library is a set of existing
code you can add-in to your program. These libraries cover things
that are common features of a program and save you from having
to write the code over and over again yourself. For example, instead
of having to write a section of code to perform a complicated mathematical equation, you can supply use a library and save yourself a huge headache.

- Python is easy to read: 
One tough part of being a programmer is the fact that, sometimes, your code does not work. When that happens, you might find yourself re-reading your code – or worse, someone else's – to try and figure out why your program is not behaving as it should. Fortunately, Python is easy to read and most of the language makes sense at a glimpse. This makes finding issues a lot easier than
more complicated languages.

- Portability: 
Python runs on many platforms and systems, meaning your programs can reach a wider audience.


- Internet of Things (IoT): 
The Internet of Things may sound like a
magical world full of digital beasts, and in some ways, it is. The IoT
consists of smart objects – light switches, doorknobs, toaster ovens,
appliances – that you find in your everyday home. These household
appliances are controllable by voice commands and mobile devices,
making them more interactive than their primitive predecessors.
I mean sure, your mom and dad yelled at the dishwasher all the
time – but did it ever listen? Now, thanks to the IoT and languages like
Python, it can! You still have to put your dishes inside of it, but still!

- Python frameworks:
Frameworks are like skeletons for a program –
they allow you to quickly set up the basics for certain types of
applications without needing to code common elements that
usually exist in the type of software you are developing. This saves
programmers time and reduces the number of errors that can occur
when you have to manually code. Python is supported by a large
number of frameworks that can make launching a new program very
rapid indeed!


**Some examples**

```python
superPowers = ['flight', 'cool cape', '20/20 vision', 'Coding Skillz']
superWeaknesses = ['bologna', 'lactose intolerance', 'social settings',
'tight trunks']
print("Behold our fledgling hero/sidekick, \"Wonder Boy!")
print("His super powers include:", *superPowers)
print("And his weaknesses are:", *superWeaknesses)

# See 01_program_like_a_superhero.py
# See 02_program_like_a_superhero.py
# See 03_program_like_a_superhero.py

```



```bash
# Print a list of Python Built-in Modules
print(help("modules"))
```

The first is `.__doc__` – also known as a docstring or documentation string.

For filename do not use complex name with underscore, use camelCasing.

```bash
# 06_program_like_a_superhero.py
# some Built-ins functions
```

```python
# Create a string of all uppercase letters
testString = "I AM YELLING!"
```


**Using Classes and Objects**
Classes. Are. Blueprints

The new architect requested the building's blueprints. => Le nouvel architecte a demandé les plans de l'immeuble.

La Classe (Class) est une méta représentation d'un objet, sa description conceptuelle, son plan. L'Objet (Object) lui découle de la Classe. Il est une illustration de la "Class", une création de la classe, une instanciation.


Rather than re-walk you through every step of the code, I will highlight some of the main features of the code we are going to add now and then input the program in its entirety for you to peruse and code on your own.



**Introducing Other Data Structures**

**TUPLES**
- Tuples, like lists and variables, are a type of data structure. Unlike variables and lists, however, tuples are considered immutable.


**DICTIONARIES**
- Dictionaries differ from lists, variables, and tuples in quite an interesting way. Whereas lists and tuples have data items that are stored at a specific index – and therefore can be referenced at those reference numbers (starting at index 0) – dictionaries rely on what is known as mapping.


Mapping is a way for Python to store data, in which Python maps keys to values. This is known as a key-value pair. The keys are defined on the left side of the key-pair value and typically relate to or
describe the value to their right. Keys are immutable and cannot be changed, while values are changeable and can be made up of any data type.
To define a dictionary, you give it a name and then enclose the data you are storing in the dictionary between two curly braces {}: algebro = {'codename': 'Algebro', 'power': 'Mathemagics', 'real-name':
'Al. G. Bro.'}

```bash
# See TupleExamples.py
```


```bash
# See 07_program_like_a_superhero_chap_9.py
```



**Working with Dictionaries**
- Python has another data structure known as a dictionary. Dictionaries differ from lists, variables, and tuples in quite an interesting way.

```python
dict.clear()# : Removes all of the items in a dictionary
dict.copy()# : Returns a copy of a dictionary
dict.fromkeys()# : Used to create a dictionary from a sequence
dict.get()# : Returns the value of a specified key
dict.items()# : Returns a view of the given dictionary's key/pair values
dict.keys()# : Returns the keys in a dictionary
dict.popitem()# : Returns – and also removes – a dictionary element
dict.pop()# : Returns – and removes – an element from a specified key
dict.setdefault()# : Checks to see if a key is present and, if not, insets the key (with a value)
dict.values()# : Returns all of the values in a dictionary
dict.update()# : Used to update a dictionary

# Other methods you can use on a dictionary include:
any()# : Tests whether an element of an iterable is True.
all()# : If all elements of an iterable are True, this returns True.
dict()# : Used to create a dictionary.
enumerate()# : Creates or returns an enumerate object.
iter()# : Returns an iterator for a given object.
len()# : Returns the length of an object.
max()# : Returns the largest element.
min()# : Returns the smallest element.
sorted()# : Returns a sorted list.
sum()# : Sums all items.

```

```





**Python for Gaming**

```python
# using Pygame
python3 -m pip install Pygame

```

There are a whole slew of them => il y en a tout un tas
ex: Plenty of superheroes have animal sidekicks. Fear of being sued and losing my vast wealth and collection of slightly vintage mopeds prevent me from naming any, but trust me, there are a whole slew of them.


**Error Handling**


```python
# See 12_program_like_a_superhero_chap_10.py
# 13_program_like_a_superhero_chap_10.py
```



```python
pin = int(input("Enter your pin number: "))
print("You entered pin: ", pin)
```


## JEU DE QUESTIONS/RÉPONSES SUR LE PYTHON

**Key Features of Python**
- Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be compiled prior to being run like certain other languages.

- Python is a multi-purpose language, capable of being used in a wide array of fields, including data science, ethical hacking, system administration, web development, mobile app development, video game programming, scientific modeling, and much more.

- Python is highly readable, easy-to-learn, yet powerful. It is an object-oriented language that is dynamically typed (this means there is no need to define the data types of variables that you declare; Python can detect, for the most part, the data type you intend).


**What Is the Difference Between a Tuple and a List**
- We covered this question in an earlier chapter and the answer is pretty simple: tuples are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed. Lists, meanwhile, are mutable, which means you can change their values. Another difference is that tuples require round braces (), while lists use square brackets []. Finally, while it may not be noticeable to a human, lists are, technically, slower than a tuple.


**What Is Inheritance?**
- We covered the concept of inheritance in our chapter that dealt with objects and classes. As you may recall, classes follow a hierarchal structure, akin to a parent-child relationship. When we have a parent – or superclass – the child class of that parent inherits the attributes and methods of the parent. Remember: classes and objects – a key feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) – are all about code reusability. A child class can inherit from one parent class or multiple parent classes, allowing for great flexibility and great coding efficiency.

**How Do You Create a List, Tuple, and Dictionary in Python**

```python
myList = ['James', 'Mike', 'Spinach Man', 'Mister Kung Food']
myTuple = ('James', 'Mike', 'Spinach Man', 'Mister Kung Food')
myDict = {'Writer' : 'James Payne', 'Student' : 'YourName'}
```


**Best Programming Practices**

Follow Style Guides: 
PEP – or Python Enhancement
Proposals – which is a list of suggestions for a wide range of topics in Python. It covers everything from deprecated (removed) modules to style guides, to guidelines on language evolution.

As an example, here is what PEP 8 has to say with regard to naming conventions:
- Classes: use capital letters for the first and second word (and any further words) in the name. For example: VillainType or MutateClass. 
- Variables, functions, methods, modules, and packages: use lowercase words separated by underscores. For example: my_hero_name or my_villain_name.


**If It's Broken, Fix It (Now, Not Later)**

Often, when we are making great headway on a program, we want to keep pushing forward. This is especially true in an office environment, when deadline pressures are looming and you start to feel a time crunch and even get harassed to finish your portion of code and move on to the next part. This mentality can become a big issue, however. While we may be tempted to ignore minor errors in our code with the thought that we can circle around to fix them later, the truth is, this thought process is more often a trap than it is a help.

An error here or there is expected, but, like an avalanche on a snowy mountain, they can quickly begin to pile up and destroy everything in their path. Errors often lead to other errors, creating a domino effect. If a portion of code doesn't work right or gives you errors, it can make other sections perform oddly. What's worse, those sections that are affected may not even give warnings or errors – causing even bigger problems down the line. The lesson here is simple: test your code often. If you find a bug, fix it immediately and do not move ahead in your work unless that problem is solved. You'll thank me later, trust me!

**Documentation Is Everything**

Use Code Repositories and Packages
Classes Are Great, But Not Everything Needs to Be One
At the end of the day, your real job is to make everything as simple as it can be. If you do that, then you will achieve the goals we spoke so much about through this book: reusable code, reducing errors, efficient code.

**The Future of Python**
The language is so simple to learn, powerful, and flexible, that the odds of it falling out of favor anytime in the foreseeable future are pretty slim.

Looming on the horizon – or knocking at your door right now depending on where you are at in your programming studies and views of technology – are high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and the ever-growing field of IoT (Internet of Things). Smart homes and connected devices are a rapidly growing market and you can be sure that Python will be a part of this mix.
