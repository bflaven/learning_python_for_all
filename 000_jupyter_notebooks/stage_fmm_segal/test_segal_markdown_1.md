**Prompt: Give me a basic php function**


```php

// Comment in PHP
/* Comment in PHP */



// Certainly! Here's a basic example of a PHP function:


<?php
// Function definition
function greet($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}

// Function invocation
greet("John");
?>


/* In this example, we define a function called greet that takes one parameter ($name). Inside the function, we use the echo statement to output a greeting message. Finally, we invoke the function by calling greet("John"), and it will output "Hello, John!". */

```

**Prompt: Give me a basic python function.**

```python

# Certainly! Here's a basic example of a Python function:

# Function definition
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Function invocation
greet("John")


'''
In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes one parameter (`name`). Inside the function, we use the `print` function to output a greeting message. Finally, we invoke the function by calling `greet("John")`, and it will print "Hello, John!" to the console.

**Prompt: Give me a basic ruby function.**

```ruby

# Certainly! Here's a basic example of a Ruby function:

ruby
# Function definition
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

# Function invocation
greet("John")

# In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes one parameter (`name`). Inside the function, we use `puts` to print a greeting message to the console. Finally, we invoke the function by calling `greet("John")`, and it will print "Hello, John!" to the console.

```

**Prompt: Prompt: Give me a basic php function**
```javascript

// Comments are made identically in PHP or in  JavaScript
// Les commentaires sont faits à l'identique en PHP ou en JavaScript

// Certainly! Here's a basic example of a JavaScript function:


// Function definition
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Function invocation
greet("John");
/*
In this example, we define a function called `greet` that takes one parameter (`name`). Inside the function, we use `console.log` to log a greeting message to the console. Finally, we invoke the function by calling `greet("John")`, and it will log "Hello, John!" to the console.
