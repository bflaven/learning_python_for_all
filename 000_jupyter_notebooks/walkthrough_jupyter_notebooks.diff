Can you give in simple words for Python programing, a defition a Class and some straightforward examples?

- OUTPUT_PROMPT_1

Let's break down the concept of a class in Python with simple words.

**Class:**
In Python, a class is like a blueprint or a template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, and it can have attributes (characteristics) and methods (actions).

**Example:**
Let's say we want to represent a simple entity, like a 'Car', using a class.

```python
# Define the class 'Car'
class Car:
    # This is a special method called the constructor
    # It initializes the object with attributes
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make  # attribute: make of the car
        self.model = model  # attribute: model of the car
        self.year = year  # attribute: manufacturing year of the car

    # Method to display information about the car
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")

# Create instances (objects) of the class 'Car'
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022)

# Access attributes and call methods of the objects
print(f"Car 1: {car1.year} {car1.make} {car1.model}")
print(f"Car 2: {car2.year} {car2.make} {car2.model}")

# Use the method to display information
car1.display_info()
car2.display_info()
```

In this example:
- `Car` is a class.
- The `__init__` method is a special method that gets called when an object is created. It initializes the object with the provided attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`).
- `display_info` is a method that prints information about the car.
- `car1` and `car2` are objects (instances) of the `Car` class, each with its own set of attributes.

So, a class helps you define a structure for your objects, and then you can create instances of that class with specific values for the attributes.
